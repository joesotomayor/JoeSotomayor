Hi, I’m Joe!

I’m a Data Scientist and Prompt Engineering enthusiast based in Arlington, VA. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and cloud-based AI, I love turning messy data into clear insights and building LLM-powered tools that automate real-world workflows. Always learning—and always up for the next challenge in data & AI!
